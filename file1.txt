first git file

Git is very fun and appears easy.

I am making updates. 

The reason for this will be test out commiting updates to a file already committed to the repo. Lets see how this goes.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is an update to the master. I switch to secondBranch and made updates.

I switched back to master currently testing the update I JUST made. 
=======
I created branch. secondBranch

I switched to secondBranch. Lets see what happens.

8.11.2022 - line add 1 - secondBranch
>>>>>>> secondBranch
